my repository with firmwares for MSp430 projects

make will build (list of targets):
rotary - handler for rotary incremental encoder connected to P2.0 & P2.1 pins, third encoder's leg supposed to be ground and MSP pins constantly driven with logical 1
rpi - 128x64 monochrome LCD driver firmware, renders status of R-PI feeded to MSP with two wires on the screen connected like source header describes
